# Insomnia Labs Frontend Developer Take-Home Test

## Instructions To Start The Project Locally

- First Clone the The Project To Your Computer
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Create a **.env.development** file and add the below environment variables

```JSON
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_ID = a5ae68e376003655e927aff3621f4d52
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY = eTShAVkZrRUksNDcyjcb_qBoVkMdwGpi
